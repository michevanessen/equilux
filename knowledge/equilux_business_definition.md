# Equilux Consulting - Business Definition Document

## Vision
To become the trusted AI automation partner for growing small businesses, helping them bridge the gap between startup hustle and enterprise efficiency without the enterprise overhead.

## Mission
We help small business owners save time and money by setting up AI agents that automate their repetitive tasks - turning meeting transcripts into organized action items, managing workflows, and connecting their business tools seamlessly - so they can focus on growth instead of getting lost in administrative work.

## Core Values

**Show, Don't Tell** - We believe in demonstrating value through live examples and transparent processes. Our "let me show you" approach builds trust and understanding.

**One of You** - We understand the small business journey because we've walked it. We speak your language, not tech jargon.

**Boutique Excellence** - We maintain a small, personal practice that delivers high-end results with approachable service.

**Practical Innovation** - We implement cutting-edge AI automation in ways that make immediate, measurable sense for your business.

**Efficiency with Empathy** - We know your time is precious and your resources are limited, so every solution we build respects both.

## Purpose
To eliminate the frustrating choice between drowning in manual work or hiring expensive staff, by creating AI-powered solutions that act like having a smart assistant who knows all your business tools and can work across them seamlessly.

## Target Personas

- **Pain Points**: 
  - Spending too much time on administrative tasks
  - Constantly switching between different software interfaces

## Marketing Strategy
